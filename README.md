Stand-Generator
===============

This is a webpage used to help people generate "Stands" for an event called "Stand Saturday" on the Stardust Crusaders subreddit.
Here is a link to what the term "Stand" means if you are not familiar with JoJo's Bizarre Adventure:

This Website uses the Itunes API for song names, a website called Whatever-Origin to extract the source code of any Webpage, and
the Powerlisting Wikia for a list of super powers.  I had to use Whatever-Origin to bypass the Same Origin-Access Policy.
