<!--Stand Generator versions 1.01
	1.  Made the ability a link since it was a pain for people to create the url themselves, and a pop-up window is annoying.
	2.  Made it one button to generate name and stats because there was no need to have two buttons.
	3.  Someone mentioned that the background music couldn't be turned off.  I allow that now as it can be perceived as annoying.
	4.  Made all of the things in the textarea reddit formatable so the user only has to copy and paste links.
	
	I really wish I could make so that the generate could get the ability and the song name, but I'm unsure of how to do that with current resources.

This website's sole purpose is to help you create a stand ability.  This website is primarily used for the "Stardust Crusaders" subreddit on reddit.com.  
<br />The way this works is you get a random ability for your stand from the link below, and then you enter the length of any album from any genre, whether you like it or not, for the name.  
<br />After you click the button, you will get your stats ranking from A to E in a format that is easy to copy and paste into a reddit comment box.
<br />
<br /> 
<a target="_blank" href="http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Random">Click the link for your Stand ability.</a>
<br />
<br />
Enter the number of songs in the artist's album: <input type="text" id="your1" value="" size="40">
<p>
The name of your stand is the <input type="text" id="your2" value="" size="4"> song on the album
<br /><br />
<input type="button" value="Generate Your Stand"
onclick="Dio('your2')">
<br /><br />
<textarea id = "myTextarea" rows="20" cols = "40"></textarea>
<br /><br />
